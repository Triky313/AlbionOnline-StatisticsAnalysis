## SETTINGS 

### ITEM LIST SOURCE
If the item list is outdated, you can change it yourself. Just change the "ITEM LIST SOURCE" URL for that. 

Another good source is https://github.com/broderickhyman/ao-bin-dumps

Or you extract the files yourself from the game. More information can be found here: https://github.com/broderickhyman/ao-id-extractor


## FAQ
### Which operating system is supported?
✅ Windows 10 and later

❌ Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8 are not supported!

❌ Linux is currently not supported!

### Can I use the tool with ExitLag or VPN?
Unfortunately, **ExitLag is not supported**, but there are other VPN services that the tool works well with. There is no support from the developers for this. Validating it would be too time-consuming.

### How fast does my internet need to be?
An internet connection with at least 1M/bit (256KB/s) download rate.

### The tool cannot download the ItemList.json or Item.json, what to do?
If a button like the one in the screenshot appears and the automatic download of the files repeatedly does not work, the following can be done:

![try-download-again-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14247773/170475039-3739e5cd-5d02-41bf-a77d-f58290de75a3.png)

Download the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/broderickhyman/ao-bin-dumps/master/formatted/items.json and rename it to ItemList.json.
and
Download this file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/broderickhyman/ao-bin-dumps/master/items.json 
Then put both files in the tools folder.

Then restart the tool and everything should work.


## INFORMATION

### Where does the price information come from?
From this project: [https://www.albion-online-data.com/](https://www.albion-online-data.com/)

Download the [Albion online data client](https://www.albion-online-data.com/) and scan the auction houses.


## CONTRIBUTING

### Problem or question?
Create an issue [here](https://github.com/Triky313/AlbionOnline-StatisticsAnalysis/issues).

### Language translation

#### How it works
To add your language, you only need to create or adapt a file in the `Languages` directory.
The file must always have the language code. 

Example:
```
en-US.xml
```

You can find language codes here: https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/

#### Create file
Copy the en-US file and change everything, then all APP-CODES should be available. 
```
<translation name = "EVERY_3_DAYS">HERE YOUR TEXT</translation>
```

## DONATIONS
This project has existed since June 2019. Almost every week I put +10 hours into this project and I love it. That's why I often don't have the time to play Albion Online. So if you want to make me happy and support this project, just donate a few items or donate on Patreon.
